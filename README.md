# OS from Scratch

Inspired by this [document](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf), this is just a learning experience for me.

I will not be covering the theory but finish till the end of [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) and add more advanced features from there until I have a mimimal usable OS.

Currently will support only 32-bit, will try to go to 64-bit if I complete the basics.
